    {
      "question": "How often should I service my HVAC system?",
      "answer": "We recommend servicing your heating system annually in the fall and your cooling system in the spring. Regular maintenance prevents breakdowns and keeps your system running efficiently."
    },
    {
      "question": "What temperature should I set my thermostat?",
      "answer": "For comfort and efficiency, we recommend 68-72°F in winter and 74-78°F in summer. Each degree you adjust can save 3-5% on energy costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do HVAC systems typically last?",
      "answer": "With proper maintenance, furnaces last 15-20 years and air conditioners last 12-15 years. Regular tune-ups can extend these lifespans significantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I replace my entire HVAC system at once?",
      "answer": "If one component is old, it often makes sense to replace both heating and cooling together for better efficiency and warranty coverage. We can assess your system and advise the best approach."
